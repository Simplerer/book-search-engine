  ## Description
  This fully functional website ran on express server and RESTful API and I refectored it to be a GraphQL API that uses Apollo Server. The idea here was to keep all the functionality of a complete project and convert it to an entirely different backend. I used Apollo Server to handle the interactions with my MongoDB database and the routing through a React platform. The original Google Books API is still used for the fetching of outside data. After converting the RESTful API backend I also refactored the logic in the frontend to handle the changes.
